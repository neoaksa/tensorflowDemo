## what is this model used forï¼Ÿ
This model is used to predict probability of snow day according to previous hours weather conditions. 
The data is download from NOAA where you can find local weather data. I used the data of Grand Rapids in period of 2014-2018.
The training process is deployed in Colaboratory by Google, the script is "**weather_prediction.ipynb**", keras model is "**weather.h5**",tensorflow model is "**weather.pd**", scale file is "**scale.pkl**", source file is "**input.csv**".

## what is the structure of this model?
1. input: 10 scaled columns
2. RNN: 2 GRU layer 
3. Output: 2 nodes with softmax

## How to deploy this model
Using flask running on python is pretty easy way to open this  model to public. You can find code in **server.py**.

## How to call server on android
Using Json to transfer array to flask server, and get feedback by string. You can find code in **Predict.java**.

## issue to be waiting to fix:
I dont think Json is a good way to transfer multidimension array, there must be another way, maybe [flatbuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) is a good method.
